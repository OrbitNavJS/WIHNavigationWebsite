    <h1>World-In-Hand Navigation</h1>
    <h4>An exploration into extending the Three.js Framework</h4>
    <h3>About the project</h3>
    <p>Three.js is a popular JavaScript library used for 3D graphics and visualizations on the web.  
      As part of the seminar "Extending the Three.js Framework," hosted by the Department of Computer Graphics Systems at Hasso-Plattner-Institute, 
      our team embarked on a journey to make a different navigation approach possible. 
      The primary goal was to explore and implement features aimed at enhancing the existing navigation capabilities, 
      while also ensuring robustness and user-friendliness.</p>
    <h2>What is World-In-Hand Navigation?</h2>
    <h3>Navigation in virtual environments</h3>
    <p>
      Navigation is a critical aspect of user interaction within virtual environments, 
      allowing users to move around and explore the digital world effectively. In the realm of 3D graphics, 
      we experience virtual environments through the lens of a virtual camera. While users may feel as though they are directly 
      manipulating the scene, it is, in fact, the camera that is being moved. This can sometimes lead to a disconnect, 
      as the scene's spatial information is not always directly incorporated into the user's interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "World-In-Hand" navigation approach aims to bridge this gap by providing users with a more intuitive and immersive navigation experience. 
      By allowing users to interact with the virtual world as if it were a tangible object in their hands, this method enhances the sense of presence 
      and control, making navigation more intuitive, robust, and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <h3>Navigation in Three.js</h3>
    <p>
      Three.js provides a range of navigation controls out of the box, including FlyControls, TrackballControls and OrbitControls, 
      with the latter being the most commonly used. These controls are available as add-ons and can be easily integrated into any Three.js project.
      Impartial to the scene, they respond to user input and adjust the camera accordingly.
      Like most navigation techniques, OrbitControls offer three primary modes of interaction: 
      translation, rotation, and zoom (techninally a dolly).
      However, these operations are focused on one predefined target point in the scene, limiting the flexibility to interact with the scene as a whole.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      Our approach to World-In-Hand navigation is based on the exact mouse position projected onto the scene.
      This allows the user to grab a point or an object and move it around (panning),
      rotate the scene around that point (rotating) or the point in the center of the screen, and zoom in and out to the point.

    </p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>
      We calculate the exact mouse position by transforming the screen mouse position into normalized device coordinates (NDC)
      and reading the depth value from the depth buffer.
      Three.js's Vector3.unproject(camera) method allows us to transform the NDC into world coordinates.
      With these world coordinates we can then calculate precise movement vectors that we apply to the camera.
